# Unit Convertor for the good of the humans slaving away in offices converting oil units with 80 or so tabs open
An Oil Unit Convertor (in material design !!!)


Pro-Tips:
  - You can do basically operations inside the text fields so you don't have to keep alt+tabing between this and your calculator
  - You can click the labels "tcf" and "tcm" to become "bcf" and "bcf" and back respectively, it converts all the other fields or just itself depending on whether its selected
  - Its Quite Small in size and file numbers and requires no permissions
  - Has all the animations you can want and a good enough icon (I hope)
